### Hi there, I'm [ChillCicada](https://chillcicada.com) / 寒蝉. 👋

In most cases, you can call me as **cc** or **chillcicada** in the Internet. Also you can call me as **hanchan** in Mandarin.

I'm an ordinary college student in China. And I'm mastering in **Chemical engineering and technology**. So I'm not a professional programmer. But I'm interested in programming and I'm trying to write good codes.

- I'm currently mainly doing some front-end programming and learning.
- I like writing some guides and archives to help learners.
- ...

For more information about me, please visit my [personal blog](https://chillcicada.com). If you have some questions or just to talk with me, you can contact me in this [page](https://github.com/chillcicada/chillcicada/issues).
